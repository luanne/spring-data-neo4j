= CRUD with repositories

The repositories provided by Spring Data Neo4j build on the composable repository infrastructure in http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories[Spring Data Commons]. 
These allow for interface-based composition of repositories consisting of provided default implementations for certain interfaces and additional custom implementations for other methods.

Spring Data Neo4j comes with a single `org.springframework.data.repository.PagingAndSortingRepository` specialisation called
`GraphRepository<T>` used for all object-graph mapping repositories.  
This sub-interface also adds specific finder methods that take a _depth_ argument to control the horizon with which related entities are fetched and saved.
Generally, it provides all the desired repository methods. 
If other operations are required then the additional repository interfaces should be added to the individual interface declaration.

[NOTE]
====
`GraphRepository` no longer combines `IndexRepository` and `TraversalRepository` because, for reasons explained
earlier, these features are no longer supported in Spring Data Neo4j as of version 4.
====


== GraphRepository

As of SDN 4, this `GraphRepository<T>` should be the interface from which your entity repository interfaces inherit, with `T` being specified as the domain entity type to persist.

Examples of methods you get for free out of `GraphRepository` are as follows.
For all of these examples the ID parameter is a `Long` that matches the graph ID:

Load an entity instance via an id::
`T findOne(id)`

Check for existence of an id in the graph::
`boolean exists(id)`

Iterate over all nodes of a node entity type::
`Iterable<T> findAll()`
`Iterable<T> findAll(Sort ...)`
`Page<T> findAll(Pageable ...)`

Count the instances of the repository entity type::
`Long count()`

Save entities::
`T save(T)` and `Iterable<T> save(Iterable<T>)`

Delete graph entities::
`void delete(T)`, `void delete(Iterable<T>)`, and `void deleteAll()`

== Query and Finder Methods

[[reference_programming_model_annotatedQueries]]
=== Annotated queries

Queries using the Cypher graph query language can be supplied with the `@Query` annotation. 

That means a repository method annotated with +
`@Query("MATCH (:Actor {name:{name}})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie) return m")` +
will use the supplied query query to retrieve data from Neo4j. 

The named or indexed parameter `{param}` will be substituted by the actual method parameter. 
Node and Relationship-Entities are handled directly and converted into their respective ids, Iterables thereof as well. 
All other parameters types are provided directly (i.e. Strings, Longs, etc).

=== Query results

Typical results for queries are `Iterable<Type>`, `Iterable<Map<String,Object>>` or simply `Type`.
Nodes and relationships are converted to their respective entities (if they exist). 
Other values are converted using the registered <<reference_programming-model_conversion,conversion services>> (e.g. enums).

=== Cypher examples

`MATCH (n) WHERE id(n)=9 RETURN n`::
returns the node with id 9

`MATCH (movie:Movie {title:'Matrix'}) RETURN movie`::
returns the nodes which are indexed with title equal to 'Matrix'

`MATCH (movie:Movie {title:'Matrix'})<-[:ACTS_IN]-(actor) RETURN actor.name`::
returns the names of the actors that have a ACTS_IN relationship to the movie node for 'Matrix'

`MATCH (movie:Movie {title:'Matrix'})<-[r:RATED]-(user) WHERE r.stars > 3 RETURN user.name, r.stars, r.comment`::
returns users names and their ratings (>3) of the movie titled 'Matrix'

`MATCH (user:User {name='Michael'})-[:FRIEND]-(friend)-[r:RATED]->(movie) RETURN movie.title, AVG(r.stars), COUNT(*) ORDER BY AVG(r.stars) DESC, COUNT(*) DESC`::
returns the movies rated by the friends of the user 'Michael', aggregated by `movie.title`, with averaged ratings and rating-counts sorted by both

Examples of Cypher queries placed on repository methods with @Query where values are replaced with method parameters,
as described in the <<reference_programming_model_annotatedQueries>>) section.

[source,java]
----
public interface MovieRepository extends GraphRepository<Movie> {
    
    // returns the node with id equal to idOfMovie parameter  
    @Query("MATCH (n) WHERE id(n)={0} RETURN n")
    Movie getMovieFromId(Integer idOfMovie);

    // returns the nodes which have a title according to the movieTitle parameter
    @Query("MATCH (movie:Movie {title={0}}) RETURN movie")
    Movie getMovieFromTitle(String movieTitle);

	// returns the Actors that have a ACTS_IN relationship to the movie node with the title equal to movieTitle parameter. 
	// (The parenthesis around 'movie' and 'actor' in the match clause are optional.)                       
	@Query("MATCH (movie:Movie {title={0}})<-[:ACTS_IN]-(actor) RETURN actor")
	Page<Actor> getActorsThatActInMovieFromTitle(String movieTitle, PageRequest page);

    // returns users who rated a movie (movie parameter) higher than rating (rating parameter)
    @Query("MATCH (movie:Movie)<-[r:RATED]-(user) " +
           "WHERE id(movie)={movieId} AND r.stars > {rating} " +
           "RETURN user")
    Iterable<User> getUsersWhoRatedMovieFromTitle(@Param("movieId") Movie movie, @Param("rating") Integer rating);

    // returns users who rated a movie based on movie title (movieTitle parameter) higher than rating (rating parameter)
    @Query("MATCH (movie:Movie {title:{0}})<-[r:RATED]-(user) " +
           "WHERE r.stars > {1} " +
           "RETURN user")
     Iterable<User> getUsersWhoRatedMovieFromTitle(String movieTitle, Integer rating);
}

=== Queries derived from finder-method names

Using the metadata infrastructure in the underlying object-graph mapper, a finder method name can be split into its semantic parts and converted into a cypher query.
Navigation along relationships will be reflected in the generated `MATCH` clause and properties with operators will end up as expressions in the `WHERE` clause.  
The parameters will be used in the order they appear in the method signature so they should align with the expressions stated in the method name.

.Some examples of methods and corresponding Cypher queries of a PersonRepository
[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends GraphRepository<Person> {

    // MATCH (person:Person {name={0}}) RETURN person
    Person findByName(String name);

    // MATCH (person:Person)
    // WHERE person.age = {0} AND person.married = {1}
    // RETURN person
    Iterable<Person> findByAgeAndMarried(int age, boolean married)

}

== Creating repositories

The `Repository` instances are only created through Spring and can be auto-wired into your Spring beans as required.

.Using basic GraphRepository CRUD-methods
[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface PersonRepository extends GraphRepository<Person> {}

public class MySpringBean {
   @Autowired 
   private PersonRepository repo;
   ...
}

// then you can use the repository as you would any other object
Person michael = repo.save(new Person("Michael", 36));

Person dave = repo.load(123);

long numberOfPeople = repo.count();
----

The recommended way of providing repositories is to define a repository interface per domain class. 
The underlying Spring repository infrastructure will automatically detect these repositories, along with additional implementation classes,
and create an injectable repository implementation to be used in services or other spring beans.

.Example Spring configuration bean
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@ComponentScan({"com.example.sdn"})
@EnableNeo4jRepositories("com.example.sdn.repo")
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class PersistenceContext {

   @Bean
   public SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
      return new SessionFactory("com.example.sdn.domain");
   }
   // more bean definition methods here
}
