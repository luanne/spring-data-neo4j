= Bean Validation (JSR-303)

NOTE: As of Spring Data Neo4j 4, Java standards validation is not supported

Spring Data Neo4j supports property-based validation as defined by JSR-303.  When a property is changed and persisted, it is checked against the annotated constraints, such as `@Min`, `@Max` and `@Size`.  Validation errors cause a `ValidationException` to be thrown. The validation support that comes with Spring is used for evaluating the constraints. To use this feature, a validator has to be registered with the `Neo4jTemplate`, which is done automatically by the `Neo4jConfiguration` if one is present in the Spring Config.

.Bean validation
====
[source,java]
----
@NodeEntity
class Person {
    @Size(min = 3, max = 20)
    String name;

    @Min(0)
    @Max(100)
    int age;
}

The validation supports needs the bean validation API and a reference implementation configured. Right now this is the Hibernate Validator by default (which is not integrated with Hibernate ORM). The maven dependency is:
