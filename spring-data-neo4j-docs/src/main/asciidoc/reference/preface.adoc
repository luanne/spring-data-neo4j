= About the Spring Data project

http://springsource.org/spring-data[Spring Data] is a SpringSource project that aims to provide Spring's convenient
programming model and well known conventions for NOSQL databases. Currently there is support for graph (Neo4j),
key-value (Redis, Riak), document (MongoDB) and relational (Oracle) databases.

The Spring Data Neo4j project, as part of the Spring Data initiative, aims to simplify development with the Neo4j graph
database. Like JPA, it uses annotations on simple POJO domain objects. Together with metadata, the annotations drive
mapping the POJO entities and their fields to nodes, relationships, and properties in the graph database.

== About SDN 4
For version 4, Spring Data Neo4j has been rewritten from scratch to natively support Neo4j deployments in standalone
server mode. It uses Cypher, the Neo4j query language, and the HTTP protocol to communicate with the database.
It's therefore worth noting that there *may be some backward compatibility issues* when migrating to version 4,
so be sure to check <<migration>> to avoid any unwanted surprises.

For integration of Neo4j and other languages, please see http://neo4j.com/developer/language-guides/[Language Guides].

= Overview

The explanation of Spring Data Neo4j's programming model starts with some underlying details. The basic concepts of
the Object-Graph Mapping (OGM) library used by Spring Data Neo4j internally, is explained in the initial chapter.

== Getting started
To get started with a simple application, you need only your domain model and (optionally) the annotations
(see <<reference_programming_model_annotations>>) provided by the library. You use annotations to mark domain objects
to be reflected by nodes and relationships of the graph database. For individual fields the annotations allow you to
declare how they should be processed and mapped to the graph. For property fields and references to other entities this
is straightforward.

== Adding queries and computed fields
To use advanced functionality like Cypher queries, a basic understanding of the graph data model is required. The graph
data model is explained in the chapter about Neo4j, see <<neo4j>>. Using computed fields that are dynamically
backed by graph operations is also possible by using the Query mechanism.

== Managing relationships
Relationships between entities are first class citizens in a graph database and therefore worth a separate chapter
(<<reference_programming_model_relationships>>) describing their usage in Spring Data Neo4j.

== Repositories
Spring Data Commons provides a very powerful repository infrastructure that is also leveraged in Spring Data Neo4j.
Those repositories consist only of a composition of interfaces that declare the available functionality in each repository.
The implementation details of commonly used persistence methods are handled by the library. At least for typical CRUD and
query-operations that is very convenient. The repositories are extensible by annotated, named or derived finder methods.
For custom implementations of repository methods you are free to add your own code. (<<reference_programming_model_repositories>>).

== Neo4jTemplate
Being a Spring Data library, Spring Data Neo4j still offers a `Neo4jTemplate` (<<reference_programming_model_template>>)
for interacting with the mapped entities and the Neo4j graph database if you don't want to use repositories.
As of version 4, `Neo4jTemplate` is based on the `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session` object. This is the same object
on which support for which Spring Data Neo4j Repositories is also based, so the underlying functionality is identical.

== Mapping Strategies
Because Neo4j is a schema-free database, Spring Data Neo4j uses a sophisticated mechanism to map Java types to Neo4j nodes
using labels. How that works is explained here: <<reference_programming_model_typerepresentationstrategy>>.

== Transactional support
Neo4j uses transactions to guarantee the integrity of your data and Spring Data Neo4j supports this fully. The implications
of this are described in the chapter around transactions. (<<reference_programming_model_transactions>>)

== Configuration
Spring Data Neo4j 4.0 only supports Java bean-based configuration. See <<setup>> for more details.

== Examples
The provided samples, which are also publicly hosted on http://spring.neo4j.org/examples[Github], are explained
in <<reference_samples>>.

== Performance
Spring Data Neo4j 4 has been rebuilt from the ground up with performance in mind. More information can be found in
<<reference_performance>>. This chapter also discusses which use cases should not be handled with Spring Data Neo4j.
